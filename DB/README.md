## How To Use

This is a full-stack program that imitates a database of historical states.  

You can search by ID, and when if there is a valid state with that ID, the program will return the state along with all of the information about it in the database.  You then have the choice to either update the information for that state, you can destroy that state from the database, or you can return to the home page.

Back on the homepage, you also have the option to show all of the states in the database.  

Finally, you have the option to create a new state and it will save in the database.  You can update or delete that state at anytime.
